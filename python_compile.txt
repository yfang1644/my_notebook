depends:
    python
        tk  (to build Tkinter)
            tcl
            libx11
                libxcb
        netbsd-curses or ncurses

libxcb needs host python

_ncurse.so needs ncurses, not netbsd-curses

patch setup.py: add 'termcap' to curses_libs
compile 32bit python-applications must set CFLAGS to target include-dir
